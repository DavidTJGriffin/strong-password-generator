# Strong Password Generator

> A browser-based application that creates secure passwords using customizable criteria.

## Description
- I created this project so that people had access to a password generator they use to help improve their security. 

This project allows users to generate random passwords directly in their web browser. It prompts for a desired password length and whether to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters. After answering the prompts, a password meeting those selections appears in the text area on the page.

## Installation & Setup

Visit the [Strong Password Generator website](https://davidtjgriffin.github.io/strong-password-generator/) to start generating passwords. No installation is required.

## Usage
On the website, click the **Generate Password** button:
- Enter a length between 8 and 128 characters.
- Confirm which character types to include.
- The generated password is displayed for you to copy.

You choose a length of 12 characters.
Do you want lowercase letters in your password? OK
Do you want uppercase letters in your password? OK
Do you want numbers in your password? OK
Do you want special characters in your password? OK
```
